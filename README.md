### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª &nbsp;About Me

Hi there, my name is Jesus; I'm a curious person. I'm passionate about technology, design, art, experimenting and coding. I'm always interested in anything related to the creative process. I've just graduated as a web developer from Ironhack Madrid. During the nine weeks there, I had the opportunity to learn from a fantastic faculty team the following technologies: Javascript (ES6), HTML5 CSS3 and the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node).

My background is in graphic design and advertising, where I had the opportunity to work for more than a decade as an art director in different industries. As a graphic designer, I learned that nothing beats the feeling of identifying a problem and coming up with a solution to it. Web development allows me to exercise my creativity and gives me almost endless resources to transform ideas into realities. It almost feels like magic to me!

This principle motivated me to shift my career toward web development, and so far, it has been a fantastic journey, packed with all kinds of emotions where I learn something new every day. To achieve this, I had to challenge myself continuously and push myself out of my comfort zone. I am really excited about continuing my personal and career growth!

When I am not busy coding or designing, I love to go outdoors and enjoy nature with my bicycle, ride my motorbike or enjoy a good meal with my buddies.
